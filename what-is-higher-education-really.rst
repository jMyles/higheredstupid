Education (n.):
===============

(1) The reproductive conduit for memetic evolution
==================================================

(2) A social bonding behavior
=============================

.. note::

	Genetic inheritance happens through sex, but crucial to the human species is that sex is primarily a social behavior, and only secondarily a reproductive behavior.

	Similarly, education is a primarily social behavior, but is the reproductive conduit for memetic evolution.

    Education is to memetic evolution as sex is to genetic evolution

    We have a special, distinct architypical place for this social gathering

.. note::

	The State is a memetic virus, with distinct operating norms, that seeks to copy its likeness into the operating systems of people, cultures, and especially institutions.

	The transmission vectors for this virus generally end in the suffix “-ism.”  By far, the two most popular and effective are sexism and racism.

Why do we have the State?
=========================

----

The "monolith" critique
=======================


.. note::
    ...is not the same thing as the existence of discrete 'governments' which claim sovereignty over various parts of the earth.

    When pointing out predictable, typical patterns of state activity, people sometimes counter by saying, “but it's not like this in Germany!  Or Costa Rica!”

    Nobody is saying that *governments* all behave the same.

    But in the presence of an autocratic world state, it's reasonable to expect that *hegemonic* governments and their “allies” (perhaps pawns) will most transparently enact statist domestic policy.
