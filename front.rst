##   :css: hovercraft.css

This is a demo for Hovercraft! You can view it as a finished presentation
at http://regebro.github.com/hovercraft/


It's also useful as an example, in which case it's supposed to be read as	
`source code <../_sources/examples/hovercraft.txt>`_.

You can render this presentation to HTML with the command::

    hovercraft hovercraft.rst outdir

And then view the outdir/index.html file to see how it turned out.

If you are seeing this text, and not reading this as source code, you are
doing it wrong! It's going to be confusing and not very useful.

Use The Source, Luke! But first you probably want to read through the
official documentation at https://hovercraft.readthedocs.org/

.. title:: Stupid Shit in Higher Ed

What is *Higher Education*, Really?
===================================

.. note::

    Welcome to the presenter console!

----

:data-x: r2000

Start at the beginning.
=======================

* First we have to invent the universe.

* Actually, we'll just start with the human condition.

The Human Condition
===================

:data-scale: 0.1

Adolescence.
=====================

Higher Ed students are adults, lower ed students are children

----

:data-x: r125
:data-y: r0

Human reproduction.
====================

One consequence of human evolution into the internet is that reproduction is both genetic and memetic.

Previously: genetic heritance available to invididuals, memetic heritance to societies.

----

Genetic inheritance happens through sex, but crucial to the human species is that sex is primarily a social behavior, and only secondarily a reproductive behavior.

Similarly, education is a primarily social behavior, but is the reproductive conduit for memetic evolution.

----

*DIAGRAM HERE!*

Education is to memetic evolution

as sex is to genetic evolution

What is the State?
==================

----

:data-x: r-350
:data-y: r75
:data-scale: 0.1

The State
=========

The State is a memetic virus, with distinct operating norms, that seeks to copy its likeness into the operating systems of people, cultures, and especially institutions.

The transmission vectors for this virus generally end in the suffix “-ism.”  By far, the two most popular and effective are sexism and racism.

----

:data-x: r125
:data-y: r0

The nature of the State.
========================

...is not the same thing as the existence of discrete 'governments' which claim sovereignty over various parts of the earth.

----

When pointing out predictable, typical patterns of state activity, people sometimes counter by saying, “but it's not like this in France!  Or Costa Rica!”

Nobody is saying that *governments* all behave the same.

But in the presence of an autocratic world state, it's reasonable to expect that *hegemonic* governments and their “allies” (perhaps pawns) will most transparently enact statist domestic policy.

----

Makes bureaucrats feel personally invested so that discussions about the wisdom of the existence of departments and offices is perceived as a personal attack rather than a reasoned plan.

----

:data-x: r-375
:data-y: r50

The state **jobifies**.

----

:data-x: r125
:data-y: r0

The worst impetus to desire education

Jobs, generally speaking, are on the way out.

Don't let politicians say they are doing right by you by creating jobs that will be available when you graduate – we need fewer jobs in this world, not more.

----

The job myth & the bureaucrat (ie, gets defensive about department cuts because 'what will I do without my job?')

----

“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

The Campus

TRIANGULAR DIAGRAM!

ANOTHER TRIANGULAR DIAGRAM OF SOME SORT!

Ancient Campuses
================

Nalanda, ancient center of higher learning in Bihar, India[20][21] from 427 to 1197

...pan...
=========

.. note::

    If you have more notes than fit in the console, you can scroll down, but
    more handily, you can scroll the text up by pressing space bar.

----

:data-rotate: 90

...rotate...
============

.. note::

   If there isn't more text to scroll up, space bar will go to the next
   slide. Therefore you, as a presenter, just press space every time you run
   out of things to say!

----

:data-x: r0
:data-y: r500
:data-scale: 0.1

...and zoom!
============

.. note::

    Zooming is cool. But one day it will grow old as well. What will we do
    then to make presentations interesting?

----

:data-x: r-800
:data-scale: 1

But Prezi is a GUI
==================

So we are back to square one.

(And it is closed source to boot)

.. note::

    It's probably back to making bad jokes again.

----

What about impress.js?
======================

It's open source!

Supports pan, tilt and zoom!


----

:id: ThreeD
:data-y: r1200
:data-rotate-x: 180

In three dimensions!
====================

*But...*

.. note::

    Wow! 3D! You didn't see that one coming, did you?

----


It's HTML...
============

Not a friendly format to edit

----

:data-x: r800

...and manual positioning
=========================

So inserting a slide means

repositioning all the following slides!


.. note::

    The endless repositioning of slides is what prompted me to write
    Hovercraft! in the first place.

----

:id: thequestion
:data-x: r0
:data-y: r-1200

*Is there no solution?*
=======================

Of course there is!

.. note::

    What would be the point of this slide show if I didn't have a solution?
    Duh!

Position slides
===============

* Automatically!
* Absolutely!
* Relative to the previous slide!
* Along an SVG path!


.. note::

    That SVG path support was a lot of work. And all I used it for was to
    position the slides in circles.

----

Presenter console!
==================

* A view of the current slide
* A view of the next slide
* Your notes
* A clock
* A timer

.. note::

    You found the presenter console already!
