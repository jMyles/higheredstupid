Adolescence.
=====================

Higher Ed students are adults, lower ed students are children

Human reproduction.
====================

One consequence of human evolution into the internet is that reproduction is both genetic and memetic.

Previously: genetic heritance available to invididuals, memetic heritance to societies.

----

Genetic inheritance happens through sex, but crucial to the human species is that sex is primarily a social behavior, and only secondarily a reproductive behavior.

Similarly, education is a primarily social behavior, but is the reproductive conduit for memetic evolution.

----

*DIAGRAM HERE!*

Education is to memetic evolution

as sex is to genetic evolution

What is the State?
==================

The State
=========

The State is a memetic virus, with distinct operating norms, that seeks to copy its likeness into the operating systems of people, cultures, and especially institutions.

The transmission vectors for this virus generally end in the suffix “-ism.”  By far, the two most popular and effective are sexism and racism.

----

The nature of the State.
========================

...is not the same thing as the existence of discrete 'governments' which claim sovereignty over various parts of the earth.

----

When pointing out predictable, typical patterns of state activity, people sometimes counter by saying, “but it's not like this in France!  Or Costa Rica!”

Nobody is saying that *governments* all behave the same.

But in the presence of an autocratic world state, it's reasonable to expect that *hegemonic* governments and their “allies” (perhaps pawns) will most transparently enact statist domestic policy.

----

Makes bureaucrats feel personally invested so that discussions about the wisdom of the existence of departments and offices is perceived as a personal attack rather than a reasoned plan.

----

The state **jobifies**.

----

The worst impetus to desire education

Jobs, generally speaking, are on the way out.

Don't let politicians say they are doing right by you by creating jobs that will be available when you graduate – we need fewer jobs in this world, not more.

----

The job myth & the bureaucrat (ie, gets defensive about department cuts because 'what will I do without my job?')

----

“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”
